# Voidtouched Items (RoR2Depletables)

A mod for Risk of Rain 2 to bypass the consumption of items to produce as a byp throduct a 'depleted' form of those items that still have the same effects as the original item but can not be consumed further.

Specifically in the current version, whenever a void item corrupts another item, a 'Voidtouched' version of that item will also be added to the inventory, so you can have both effects active at once.

Currently, items upgraded by Benthic Bloom or consumed by Egocentrism do not produce Voidtouched items.
